# Epoch Time Converter Utility

This is a small, handy utility for converting Unix epoch timestamps to human-readable dates and times in various time zones (GMT, CET, IST). I created it to help with some work-related tasks, and I thought it might be useful to others as well!

## Features

*   **Epoch Input:** Enter a Unix epoch timestamp (seconds since January 1, 1970, UTC).
*   **Real-time Display:** Shows the current epoch time and the current time in GMT.
*   **Time Zone Conversions:** Displays the corresponding date and time in GMT, CET (Central European Time), and IST (Indian Standard Time).
*   **Copy to Clipboard:** Easily copy the entered epoch time to your clipboard.
*   **Set Current Time:** Quickly set the input to the current epoch time.
* **Open Source:** Feel free to contribute to the project on GitHub.

## Why I Built This

I found myself frequently needing to convert epoch times during my work. This little tool streamlines that process and makes it much easier to visualize time across different time zones.

## How to Use

1.  Enter an epoch timestamp in the "Epoch Input" field.
2.  View the converted times in GMT, CET, and IST.
3.  Click "Set Current Time" to use the current epoch.
4. Click "Copy" to copy the epoch to the clipboard.
